    <span><p>This tutorial explains how to insert pictures into Wikipedia articles using wikitext. This is one of the most frequently asked questions. It describes options for specifying placement, alt text, captions, sizes and links, and contains advice about panoramas and avoiding image stackups. There is also a technical document describing the syntax and a simple guide for beginners. The same syntax is used regardless of whether a file is from Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons.</p></span>
